## Getting started

### Installation
1. Download the latest release for your operating system [here](https://github.com/V4NSH4J/dankgrinder/releases) (darwin is for macOS), or [build from source](#building-from-source). If you build from source you can delete everything besides the compiled binaries and config.yml.
2. Extract the archive
3. [Configure](#configuration). Make sure `token` and `channel_id` fields of the instance are set, it will not run otherwise

#### Windows
4. Double click dankgrinder.exe. If the program closes immediately after opening it, open a command prompt and drag the executable to it, then hit enter. You will now be able to see the error

#### Linux
4. Run the binary:  
   `$ ./dankgrinder`

#### macOS
4. Run by double clicking the dankgrinder binary

### Getting an authorization token
1. Go to Discord, logged into the account you want to use
2. Open the inspector by pressing `ctrl` + `shift` + `i`
3. Click the "network" tab
4. Refresh the page
5. Look for any entry called "science" and click on it
6. Expand the "request headers" and look for the value "authorization", that is your token

### Enabling Discord's developer mode
To obtain a channel id for config.yml, you will need to have developer mode enabled.
1. Go to your user settings on Discord
2. Click "appearance" under "app settings"
3. Scroll down to "advanced" and enable developer mode

You can now right click any user or channel to obtain the id.

## Building from source
If you use an architecture other than amd64, or you want to build from source for another reason, doing so is quite simple.

### Prerequisites
A working Go installation, see https://golang.org/doc/install.

### Building
1. Clone the repository:  
   `$ git clone https://github.com/dankgrinder/dankgrinder.git`
2. Build:  
   `$ make build`

The executables should then be in the `/build` folder.

Alternate method for building: 
1. Install golang from https://golang.org
2. In a command prompt or a terminal, navigate to the dankgrinder folder and build:
   `$ go build`

## Configuration
All configuration can be done by editing config.yml with your editor of choice (e.g. Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Notepad++). The comments in the file itself provide extra explanation where necessary. For the bot to run, you must at least enter an [authorization token](#getting-an-authorization-token) and a [channel id](#enabling-discords-developer-mode). If you are running into issues, you can [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/Fjzpq8YPSn).

If you do not know how yaml works and are getting fatal errors, use [this guide](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/yaml/yaml_basics.htm) to learn the basics of yaml. Configuration errors are characterized by a near-instant fatal error when starting the program. If the program opens and then closes immediately on Windows, open a command prompt first, drag the executable onto it and hit enter. You should now be able to see the error.

A question mark after a field name means this field is optional.

Shifts are integral for running dankgrinder safely without being banned. Hosting dankgrinder on services like repl.it might mess-up the shifts and repeat the first active shift over and over again. This is not an issue with dankgrinder but one with repl.it and allocation of it's resources. If you wish to host dankgrinder, consider a VPS.

`base` | integer | The base delay in milliseconds. [Read more about base and variation](#base-and-variation)
`variation` | integer | The random variation of the delay in milliseconds. [Read more about base and variation](#base-and-variation)

### Base and variation
A base is a value that forms the base for a final result; it is the value that the program starts with.

A variation is a random value, from 0 up to but excluding n, added to a starting value.

Say a base value of 100, and a variation of 50 are used. The final result will be a number from 100 up to and including 149 because of the random value added by the variation.

### Shifts
You can use shifts to make sure the bot is not suspicious because it is too active. We highly recommended using this option, and not running this program 24/7. An uptime of 50% per instance or less is advisable.

For example, if you would like to have the bot be active for 6 hours per day, then inactive for the remaining 18 you would do something like this (note that it will loop this, so after completing the last shift it will go back to the first):
```yaml
shifts:
  - state: "active"
    duration:
      base: 21600
      variation: 0
  - state: "dormant"
    duration:
      base: 64800
      variation: 0
```

### Custom commands
```yaml
custom_commands:
  - value: "pls command1"
    interval: 60
  - value: "pls command2"
    interval: 300
    amount: 5
  - value: "pls command3"
  - value: "pls buy zz 20"
    pause_below_balance: 9000000
```
In example custom command 1, the value is sent every 60 seconds for infinite times, until the program enters the dormant state.

In example custom command 2, the value is sent every 5 minutes for a total of 5 times per active shift.

In example custom command 3, the value is sent once in the beginning of every active shift.

In example custom command 4, 20 zz will be bought whenever the balance is above 9,000,000.

### Instances
Example if you would like to run two or more instances simultaneously and 24/7. You may add as many as you wish. (this shift configuration is not recommended):
```yaml
clusters:
  default:
    master:
      token: "bmljZSB0cnkgYnV0IHRoaXMgaXM.bm90IGE.cmVhbCB0b2tlbg"
      channel_id: "791694339116892202"
    instances:
      - token: "b2YgY291cnNlIHRoaXM.aXNuJ3QgYQ.cmVhbCB0b2tlbiBlaXRoZXIsIHNpbGx5"
        channel_id: "791694383098495047"
      - token: "fU8Di291cnNlIHRoaXM.aXNuJ3QgYQ.cmVhbCB0b2tlbiBlaXRoZXIsIHNpbGx5"
        channel_id: "791694383098495048"
```

### Default values and when you can leave out fields
Because of the way Go structs work, most times, when you leave out a field in your config, it will default to a value such as `0` or `false`. This is useful to avoid clutter. In the default config many fields are left out because their values would have been set to `0` or `false`, but they are still available for use, of course. Simply lookup what configuration is possible for your object of choice in the [configuration documentation](#configuration) above.

The only exception is the fields which are currently marked as optional, the `features`, `suspicion_avoidance` and `shifts` fields on every [instance object](#instance-object). These fields are used to override the values you have specified in the regular `features`, `suspicion_avoidance` and `shifts` objects in the config. If you leave out one of these fields or a child field of one of these fields, the default configuration is not overridden and is used instead.

```yaml
clusters:
   default:
      master:
         token: "bmljZSB0cnkgYnV0IHRoaXMgaXM.bm90IGE.cmVhbCB0b2tlbg" # Instance 1
         channel_id: "791694339116892202"
      instances:
         - token: "b2YgY291cnNlIHRoaXM.aXNuJ3QgYQ.cmVhbCB0b2tlbiBlaXRoZXIsIHNpbGx5" # Instance 2
           channel_id: "791694383098495047"
           shifts:
              - state: "active"
         - token: "MTI3OTgzNDcyMTkzNDM4Mg.ZmRzdg.dGhpcyBpcyBub3QgYW4gYWN0dWFsIH" # Instance 3
           channel_id: "791691923098486933"
           features:
              auto_tidepod:
                 enable: false

shifts:
  - state: "active"
    base: 21600
  - state: "dormant"
    base: 32400
```

In the example above, all instances use a shift configuration of 6 hours active, 9 hours dormant, except for the second instance. This instance overrides the shift configuration defined below with a shift configuration that is always active. 

The third instance in this example, overrides the normal configuration with one where auto-tidepod is disabled (the rest of the config is left out for simplicity), the rest of the instances would still use auto-tidepod if it was enabled. 

## Disclaimer
This is a self-bot. Such bots are against Discord's terms of service. Automation of Dank Memer commands also breaks Dank Memer's rules. By using this software you acknowledge that we take no responsibility whatsoever for any action taken against your account, whether by Discord or Dank Memer, for not abiding by their respective rules.

Despite this, we believe the chance of detection by either Discord or Dank Memer to be low provided that you take appropriate measures to ensure this. This includes but is not limited to running the bot only in private channels, not being open about the fact that you use it and not running so much as to raise suspicion.
